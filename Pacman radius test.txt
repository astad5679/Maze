Normal PacMan maze:
1: 23
2: 34
3: 41 //this is the most optimal radius, based on test results only
4: 34
5: 36 //starting here, pacman will always take the same path, and therefore be eaten after the same number of steps (min and max are the same and there is no standard 		//deviation)
6: 36
7: 36
...
10: 36 

Ms PacMan maze:
1: 28
2: 26
3: 57 //the most optimal radius is the same as earlier, coincidence?
4: 55
5: 38
6: 25 //from here on, the same phenomenon as earlier will occur, except curiosly enough, this is a worse outcome then having a smaller radius (unlike above)
...
10: 25 //as if this was a surprise)
